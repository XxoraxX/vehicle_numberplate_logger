# Car-Detection-using-HOG-based-Detector(Dlib)
Hi there i have trained a HOG based detector that detects the cars in a given frame. I have used over 1000 images of cars to train it and i have done this using Dlib. If you want to know how i trained it then you should definetly visit this
https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/python_examples/train_object_detector.py
I have added the detector file and the test code in which you can load the detector ad process it frame by frame.
## Pre requisites 
<br />
1. you need to install 2.4.x version of opencv. i have used open cv to capture video frame by frame you can also use any method to capture it. <br />
2.you need to install dlib python binding here is a good post https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/. <br />
3.you need to instal python and skimage. <br />

## Disclaimer
The accuracy of this detector varies in different conditions it will give you best possible results in Daylight.
